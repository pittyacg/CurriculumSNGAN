# CurriculumSNGAN
The code for our paper on using Curriculum Learning for GANs.

Our code is based on the SNGAN implementation available at: https://github.com/watsonyanghx/GAN_Lib_Tensorflow/tree/master/SNGAN. Here we will explain and provide code only for the Curriculum part, which you can easily add to any other model.

In the future, we plan to provide our own clean implementation of the full network.
