# CurriculumSNGAN

The code for our paper: Image Difficulty Curriculum for Generative Adversarial Networks (Petru Soviany, Claudiu Ardei, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Marius Leordeanu) - WACV 2020.

The full paper can be consulted here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08967.

Our code is based on the SNGAN implementation available at: https://github.com/watsonyanghx/GAN_Lib_Tensorflow/tree/master/SNGAN. 
Here we will explain and provide code only for the Curriculum part, which you can easily add to any other model. 
In the future, we plan to provide our own clean implementation of the full network.
